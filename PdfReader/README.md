Allows to user to render pdf files inside unity scene. User can also navigate through pdf as an ordinary pdf file. The application for this utility can be many like- on the go file sharing or Presentation in multi-user scenario. Especially in case VR conferencing this can be very useful.

Don't expect the package manager to work right out of repo. I had to spend entire night to figure out how to render pdf in unity. Where I had to mod the Unity setup itself for it to work in editor mode. Feel free to get in touch for queries and comments.
